Hi my name is Matthew and I will be posting c++ projects from my course at Macomb Community College.

cheesy.cpp is a programming assignment that I did to test out format manipulators in c++

the 3rd week assignment for my c++ class is a program that uses io manipulators, file streaming, and if else statements to help with inputting, outputting, and calculating data for shipping costs

Vowel_counter reads from an html file and counts the vowels plus m, k, and p. it also takes the uppercase letters into account
